            <p>Plants need water, but too much water can be dangerous. Look above at all the adaptations that rainforest plants have to help them survive the wet environment. Life in the water can be even very hard. Very few plants have adapted to life in the water. Of all the plants on earth, only a small fraction grow in the water. Those that do have special adaptations to help them survive.</p>
